		of each one of them as well as in the amount of information they store.

	Mass storage device: In cases, mass storage is managed or device storage, where external devices 
			     help to manage large amounts of information that increase the storage capacity 
			     of a native storage device.

	Input device: Input devices are those that input information into a computer from an external source.

	Output device: Output devices are the devices in a computer for communicating information.

	Central Processing Unit (CPU): The CPU is responsible for processing all the main operations of a
